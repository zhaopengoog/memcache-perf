Type './mcperf -h' for a full list of command-line options.  At
minimum, a server must be specified.

    $ ./mcperf -s localhost

	Total QPS = 16082.2 (80411 / 5.0s)

	Misses = 0 (0.0%)
	Skipped TXs = 0 (0.0%)

	RX   19861517 bytes :    3.8 MB/s
	TX    2894832 bytes :    0.6 MB/s
	CPU Usage Stats (avg/min/max): 2.21%,0.38%,4.05%

mcperf reports the latency (average, minimum, and various
percentiles) for get and set commands, as well as achieved QPS and
network goodput. A separate thread is also keeping track of client CPU usage on the master.
A warning will be issued if the master client CPU usage goes above 95%.
In that case, it is recommended to add more machines as agents.
If verbose (-v) flag is enabled on the an agent, it will report it's cpu usage as well.

To achieve high request rate, you must configure mcperf to use
multiple threads, multiple connections, connection pipelining, or
remote agents.

    $ ./mcperf -s zephyr2-10g -T 24 -c 8
    #type       avg     min     1st     5th    10th    90th    95th    99th

    TX   57374136 bytes :   10.9 MB/s

Suggested Usage
===============

Real deployments of memcached often handle the requests of dozens,
hundreds, or thousands of front-end clients simultaneously.  However,
by default, mcperf establishes one connection per server and meters
requests one at a time (it waits for a reply before sending the next
request).  This artificially limits throughput (i.e. queries per
second), as the round-trip network latency is almost certainly far
longer than the time it takes for the memcached server to process one
request.

In order to get reasonable benchmark results with mcperf, it needs
to be configured to more accurately portray a realistic client
workload.  In general, this means ensuring that (1) there are a large
number of client connections, (2) there is the potential for a large
number of outstanding requests, and (3) the memcached server saturates
and experiences queuing delay far before mcperf does. I suggest the
following guidelines:

1. Establish more than 50 connections per memcached _server_
thread.
2. Don't exceed more than about 10 connections per _mcperf_ thread.
3. Use multiple mcperf agents in order to achieve (1) and (2).
4. Do not use more mcperf threads than hardware cores/threads.


Here's an example:

    memcached_server$ memcached -t 4 -c 32768
    agent1$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent2$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent3$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent4$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent5$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent6$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent7$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    agent8$ mcperf -T 16 -A
    master$ mcperf -s memcached_server --loadonly
    master$ mcperf -s memcached_server --noload \
        -B -T 16 -Q 1000 -D 4 -C 4 \
        -a agent1 -a agent2 -a agent3 -a agent4 \
        -a agent5 -a agent6 -a agent7 -a agent8 \
        -c 4 -q 200000

This will create 8*16*4 = 512 connections total, which is about 128
per memcached server thread.  This ought to be enough outstanding
requests to cause server-side queuing delay, and no possibility of
client-side queuing delay adulterating the latency measurements.

                                      number is divided by the number of servers.

                                      late.  This harms the long-term QPS average, 
                                      but reduces spikes in QPS after long latency 
                                      requests.

                                      QPS where 95% of requests are faster than 
                                      1000us).
          --scan=min:max:step       Scan latency across QPS rates from min to max.

                                      this client.  (default=`1')
      -C, --measure_connections=INT Master client connections per server, overrides 
                                      --connections.
      -Q, --measure_qps=INT         Explicitly set master client QPS, spread across

      -D, --measure_depth=INT       Set master client connection depth.
    
    The --measure_* options aid in taking latency measurements of the
    memcached server without incurring significant client-side queuing
    delay.  --measure_connections allows the master to override the
    --connections option.  --measure_depth allows the master to operate as
    an "open-loop" client while other agents continue as a regular
    closed-loop clients.  --measure_qps lets you modulate the QPS the
    master queries at independent of other clients.  This theoretically
    normalizes the baseline queuing delay you expect to see across a wide
    range of --qps values.
    
    Some options take a 'distribution' as an argument.
    Distributions are specified by <distribution>[:<param1>[,...]].
    Parameters are not required.  The following distributions are supported:
    
       [fixed:]<value>              Always generates <value>.
       uniform:<max>                Uniform distribution between 0 and <max>.
       normal:<mean>,<sd>           Normal distribution.
       exponential:<lambda>         Exponential distribution.
       pareto:<loc>,<scale>,<shape> Generalized Pareto distribution.
       gev:<loc>,<scale>,<shape>    Generalized Extreme Value distribution.
    
       To recreate the Facebook "ETC" request stream from [1], the
       following hard-coded distributions are also provided:
    
       fb_value   = a hard-coded discrete and GPareto PDF of value sizes
       fb_key     = "gev:30.7984,8.20449,0.078688", key-size distribution
       fb_ia      = "pareto:0.0,16.0292,0.154971", inter-arrival time dist.

                                  this client.  (default=`1')
  -C, --measure_connections=INT Master client connections per server, overrides
                                  --connections.
  -Q, --measure_qps=INT         Explicitly set master client QPS, spread across
                                  threads and connections.
  -D, --measure_depth=INT       Set master client connection depth.
  -m, --poll_freq=INT           Set frequency in seconds for agent protocol
                                  recv polling.  (default=`1')
  -M, --poll_max=INT            Set timeout for agent protocol recv polling. An
                                  agent not responding within time limit will
                                  be dropped.  (default=`120')

The --measure_* options aid in taking latency measurements of the
memcached server without incurring significant client-side queuing
delay.  --measure_connections allows the master to override the
--connections option.  --measure_depth allows the master to operate as
an "open-loop" client while other agents continue as a regular
closed-loop clients.  --measure_qps lets you modulate the QPS the
master queries at independent of other clients.  This theoretically
normalizes the baseline queuing delay you expect to see across a wide
range of --qps values.

Predefined profiles to approximate some use cases:
1. memcached for web serving benchmark : p95, 20ms, FB key/value/IA, >4000
connections to the device under test.
2. memcached for applications backends : p99, 10ms, 32B key , 1000B value,
uniform IA,  >1000 connections
3. memcached for low latency (e.g. stock trading): p99.9, 32B key, 200B value,
uniform IA, QPS rate set to 100000	
4. P99.9, 1 msec. Key size = 32 bytes; value size has uniform distribution from
100 bytes to 1k; 

Some options take a 'distribution' as an argument.
Distributions are specified by <distribution>[:<param1>[,...]].
Parameters are not required.  The following distributions are supported:

   [fixed:]<value>              Always generates <value>.
   uniform:<max>                Uniform distribution between 0 and <max>.
   normal:<mean>,<sd>           Normal distribution.
   exponential:<lambda>         Exponential distribution.
   pareto:<loc>,<scale>,<shape> Generalized Pareto distribution.
   gev:<loc>,<scale>,<shape>    Generalized Extreme Value distribution.

   To recreate the Facebook "ETC" request stream from [1], the
   following hard-coded distributions are also provided:

   fb_value   = a hard-coded discrete and GPareto PDF of value sizes
   fb_key     = "gev:30.7984,8.20449,0.078688", key-size distribution
   fb_ia      = "pareto:0.0,16.0292,0.154971", inter-arrival time dist.
